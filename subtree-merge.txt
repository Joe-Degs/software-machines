/* 
   I was looking for a way to add another local repo as a subdirectory to this
   repo. Got a little stressed by the amount of info on stack overflow.
   i got one that worked for me using the git subtree command.

  so i'm keeping this here for if i ever need it again.

  lets say we want to add project_b as subdir in project_a
*/


cd <project_a>
git remote add -f <b_remote> <path/to/project_b>
git merge -s ours (--allow-unrelated-histories) --no-commit b_remote/master
git read-tree --prefix=<project_b/> b_remote/master
git commit -m "Merge project_b as subdirectory in project_a"
git pull -s subtree b_remote master
